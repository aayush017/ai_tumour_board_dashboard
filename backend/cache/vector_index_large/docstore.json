The Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver (INASL) first published its guidelines to aid healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC in 2014. These guidelines were subsequently updated in 2019. However, INASL has recognized the need to revise its guidelines in 2023 due to recent rapid advancements in the diagnosis and management of HCC, particularly for intermediate and advanced stages. The aim is to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations tailored to the Indian context. To accomplish this, a task force was formed, and a two-day round table discussion was held in Puri, Odisha. During this event, experts in their respective fields deliberated and finalized consensus statements to develop these updated guidelines. The 2023 INASL guidelines offer a comprehensive framework for the diagnosis, staging, and management of intermediate and advanced HCC in India. They represent a significant step forward in standardizing clinical practices nationwide, with the primary objective of ensuring that patients with HCC receive the best possible care based on the latest evidence. The guidelines cover various topics related to intermediate and advanced HCC, including biomarkers of aggressive behavior, staging, treatment options, and follow-up care.** (J CLIN EXP HEPATOL xxxx;xxx:xxx)\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer, continues to present significant treatment challenges despite notable advancements in its management. In 2014, the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver (INASL) published the initial set of guidelines on HCC,<sup>1</sup> followed by an update in 2019,<sup>2</sup> to offer healthcare professionals guidance for diagnosis and management. Since then, significant developments have occurred in the field, particularly in the diagnosis and management of intermediate and advanced HCC. Consequently, INASL has decided to revise its guidelines, providing evidence-based recommendations tailored to the Indian context. The updated guidelines cover various topics, including risk factors, screening and diagnosis, staging, treatment options, and follow-up care, with a focus on intermediate and advanced HCC. By incorporating the latest advancements in the field, these guidelines have the potential to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals in India.\n\n## METHODS\n\nTo formulate the updated guidelines, a task force was established to review the previous guidelines and integrate recent advancements in treatments relating to intermediate and advanced HCC. The task force organized a two-day round table discussion on May 14th and 15th, 2022, in Puri, Odisha. The discussion involved thorough debates and deliberations among the task force members, who were experts in their respective fields, to finalize the consensus statements for the revised guidelines. Each issue was meticulously addressed, taking into account the most relevant data available in the literature. The final consensus statements were developed based on scientific evidence and the clinical expertise and experience of the participating physicians. Only those statements that obtained approval from the majority (>50%) of the task force members were accepted.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of the guidelines, each statement was graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, with minor modifications.<sup>3,4</sup> The GRADE system assesses the quality of the underlying evidence as high, moderate, or low for each recommendation. The strength of the recommendations, either strong or weak, reflects the quality of the underlying evidence, as outlined in Table 1. Overall, the task force adopted a rigorous approach in developing the updated guidelines, incorporating the latest scientific evidence along with the clinical expertise and experience of the members. By adhering to a stringent grading system, the guidelines provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations tailored to the Indian context, offering the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with HCC.\n\n## Indicators of Aggressive Tumor Biology\n\nThis section discusses indicators of aggressive tumor biology in HCC. Clinical indicators include gender differences, age, symptoms at presentation, hepatitis status, liver dysfunction, and diabetes. Radiological indicators encompass tumor size, number, encapsulation, differentiation, and vascular invasion. Biochemical markers such as alpha fetoprotein (AFP), des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) (also known as protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II)), and *Lens culinaris agglutinin A-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein* (AFP-L3) as well as nuclear medicine techniques like <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), provide additional\n\n**2    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Understanding these indicators aids in prognosis prediction and personalized treatment planning for HCC patients.\n\n## Clinical Indicators of Aggressiveness\n\nGender differences in HCC morbidity and survival outcomes are well-documented.<sup>5\u20137</sup> Women have a lower risk of developing HCC compared to men, with an approximate incidence ratio of 1:4.<sup>5,8</sup> Women also tend to present with less-advanced HCC and have a greater overall survival.<sup>9</sup> The gender disparity in HCC may stem from various factors, including hormonal, genetic, anatomic, metabolic, behavioral risk factors, tumor biology, and treatments received.<sup>10</sup>\n\nWhile it is generally believed that younger patients with HCC often have more invasive tumors, higher metastatic potential, and worse survival and prognosis compared to older patients,<sup>11,12</sup> some subsequent studies have refuted this finding.<sup>13</sup>\n\nHCC detected at the asymptomatic stage generally has a better prognosis. The appearance of symptoms such as lethargy, pain, jaundice, anasarca, ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, diarrhea, and paraneoplastic symptoms indicates the development of severe and aggressive disease.<sup>14,15</sup> These symptoms may indicate either an aggressively growing tumor leading to decompensation or advanced liver disease, which may preclude effective curative treatment.\n\nA Japanese study identified independent risk factors for length of disease-free survival after curative resection of HCC. The study found that younger age, lower indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate, presence of solitary HCC with expansive growth, absence of microscopic portal invasion, and lower activity of co-existing hepatitis were favorable factors for longer disease-free survival, highlighting the importance of not only early detection, but also suppression of co-existing hepatitis, in achieving better disease-free survival.<sup>16</sup>\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus not only increases the risk of developing HCC<sup>17,18</sup> but is also associated with worse survival.<sup>19</sup> A meta-analysis of 21 studies comprising 9767 HCC patients found that diabetes in HCC patients was independently associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival.<sup>20</sup> Hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation in diabetic patients contribute to a poor prognosis.\n\nNumerous reports indicate that perioperative blood transfusion enhances the risk of intrahepatic recurrence of HCC and is a significant independent factor influencing the cumulative survival rate of patients.<sup>21\u201324</sup>\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxx    3\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\nFOLLOWING CONTEXT:\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n**4** \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Zhou *et al.* conducted a comparative study involving 1000 patients with small HCC (\u22645 cm) and 1366 patients with large HCC (>5 cm) during the same period. They observed that larger HCC tumors were associated with a lower curative resection rate, higher operative mortality rate, increased incidence of tumor emboli in the portal vein, and lower overall survival.<sup>25</sup> The presence of multiple nodules in HCC (multi-nodular HCC) indicates a much poorer prognosis compared to single nodules.<sup>26,27</sup> Poorly encapsulated HCC tumors are also linked to worse prognosis compared to well-encapsulated tumors.<sup>28</sup> The features listed, including tumor size and number, washout rate, intracellular fat accumulation, invasive growth, absence of a capsule, bile duct invasion, and tumor thrombosis of the portal and/or hepatic vein, are indeed indicators associated with poor prognosis in HCC. These characteristics can suggest both aggressive tumor behavior and late detection. More aggressive tumors tend to grow and spread more rapidly, leading to these concerning features, while late detection can mean that these features have had more time to develop, reflecting a more advanced stage of disease and subsequently poorer prognosis. It is important to note that the boundary between aggressive behavior and late detection can be blurred, as late detection might be the consequence of rapid and aggressive tumor growth that advances before symptoms prompt medical attention.\n\nFunctional imaging techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), chemical-shift magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and MRI with liver-specific contrast have revolutionized the management of HCC. These techniques provide valuable insights into cellular and metabolic activities, aiding in the effective grading and staging of HCC. DWI assesses the cellularity and integrity of cell membranes,<sup>29</sup> while chemical-shift MRI exploits differences in resonance frequencies of water and fat protons for contrast generation.<sup>30</sup> MRE quantifies tissue stiffness to detect fibrosis or cirrhosis.<sup>31</sup> MRI with liver-specific contrast helps in better lesion characterization.<sup>32</sup> These advancements contribute to a holistic approach to HCC management, from diagnosis to treatment planning. Thus these techniques can provide valuable cellular and metabolic information for HCC grading and staging.<sup>33,34</sup>\n\n| Consensus statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Tumor size and number, intracellular fat accumulation, invasive growth, absence of capsule, bile duct invasion, and tumor thrombosis of the portal and/or hepatic vein are all indicators associated with a poor prognosis in HCC.                                               | Moderate          | Strong                     |\n| Functional imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), chemical-shift MRI, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and MRI with liver-specific contrast play a valuable role in providing cellular and metabolic information for the grading and staging of HCC. | Moderate          | Weak                       |\n\n\n## *Biochemical Indicators of Aggressiveness*\n\nTumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) (also known as protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II)), and *Lens culinaris* agglutinin A-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3), are extensively studied biomarkers for assessing the aggressiveness of HCC. Elevated levels of these tumor markers indicate tumor stage progression and are associated with a worse prognosis, higher recurrence rate, and poorer survival compared to individuals with normal marker levels.<sup>35</sup> In 2006, researchers from Japan developed the BALAD score, which incorporates AFP >400 ng/mL, AFP-L3 >15%, DCP >100 mAU/ mL, as well as serum bilirubin and albumin values, to predict HCC patient survival.<sup>36</sup> Although initial validation studies did not demonstrate the superiority of this score over other systems without biomarkers, the combined use of biomarkers may still have predictive value for prognosis. Based on a review of Indian studies, it is evident that both elevated levels of AFP and PIVKA-II are associated with aggressive HCC. However, specific cut-off values for AFP and PIVKA-II to predict the aggressiveness of HCC cannot be conclusively determined from the current Indian studies.<sup>37\u201341</sup>\n\nPost-transplant recurrence affects up to 15% of HCC patients transplanted within the Milan criteria,<sup>42</sup> highlighting the role of factors beyond tumor morphology in post-liver transplantation (LT) prognosis.

The French Liver Transplantation Study Group proposed a prognostic model in 2012 that combined AFP with tumor size and number, demonstrating its superiority over the Milan criteria alone in predicting HCC recurrence and overall survival after LT. Additionally, an AFP level >1000 ng/mL was associated with significantly higher HCC recurrence risk and worse post transplant survival among patients within the Milan criteria.<sup>43</sup> This cutoff level has been validated in subsequent studies, with AFP >1000 ng/dL currently being used as an exclusion criterion for LT.\n\nPositive AFP at baseline and relapse, or a change from negative to positive, imply shorter survival rates. Conversely, a complete AFP response to locoregional therapies (LRT) suggests the lowest recurrence rates, while a partial response, marked by over a 15% decline post-LRT, yields outcomes similar to the control group.<sup>44,45</sup> Serum AFP estimation further helps monitor responses to locoregional and systemic HCC therapies.<sup>46\u201348</sup>\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Elevated levels of commonly used HCC tumor markers (AFP, PIVKA-II, AFP-L3) are associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of recurrence.                   | High              | Strong                     |\n| The combined use of these biomarkers may offer benefits in predicting prognosis.                                                                                         | High              | Strong                     |\n| Currently, an AFP level exceeding 1000 ng/dL is utilized as an exclusion criterion for liver transplantation (LT).                                                       | Moderate          | Strong                     |\n| Serum AFP estimation can also be valuable in monitoring the response to therapy, particularly with the emergence of more effective locoregional and systemic treatments. | High              | Strong                     |\n\n\n## Nuclear Medicine Indicators of Prognosis/Aggressiveness\n\nThe clinical value of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in diagnosing HCC has been limited due to its low sensitivity (between 36% and 70%) for detecting intrahepatic HCC lesions. Nevertheless, the use of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) for prognosticating HCC has shown significant progress in recent years.<sup>49,50</sup> A study from a non-transplant center in India suggested that <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT can be valuable in the initial work-up of newly diagnosed HCC patients, especially when there are high levels of AFP (>93.7 ng/mL) or a large tumor (>5 cm).<sup>41</sup> FDG uptake is closely related to therapeutic response in HCC and can provide additional information on the risk of HCC recurrence after surgery or liver transplantation (LT). Another study from India utilized FDG avidity to predict post-transplant survival, as poorly differentiated HCC showed higher FDG avidity compared to well-differentiated HCC.<sup>51</sup> FDG PET avidity was associated with higher levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and a higher incidence of microvascular invasion on explant histology.<sup>40</sup> If FDG-PET demonstrates uptake in the tumor, it is suggestive of high possibility of microvascular invasion.<sup>52</sup> However, absence of PET uptake does not rule out microvascular invasion.\n\nDynamic CT with FDG-PET is a convenient modality for detecting portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), characterized by intraluminal filling defects, expansion of the portal vein, contrast enhancement, and linear increased FDG uptake by the thrombus.<sup>53</sup>\n\nSince extrahepatic metastasis is commonly observed in HCC with poor differentiation, FDG-PET has demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other modalities such as bone scans for the detection of extrahepatic metastasis.<sup>54</sup>\n\n<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET-CT has shown efficiency in assessing the viability of HCC after TACE and superiority to CECT even in low-grade HCC.<sup>55</sup> It can effectively differentiate between HCC recurrence and false-positive tracer uptake due to lipiodol (ethiodized oil) deposition. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), which represents the extent of abnormally increased FDG uptake by tumor tissue, has the potential to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).<sup>56</sup> One study showed that using FDG-PET can help predict the effectiveness of palliative radiotherapy in controlling bone metastasis. Essentially, better results were seen when patients had a higher initial reading (SUV-ratio) on the scan, a significant drop in the SUV-ratio after radiotherapy, and when a higher dose of radiation was used.<sup>57</sup> PET-derived tumor-to-normal liver ratio (TLR), calculated as SUV-max of the tumor divided by SUV-mean of the normal liver, is a valuable parameter for determining HCC aggressiveness. Several reports indicate that TLR \u22652 indicates high malignant potential. High TLR significantly affects overall survival (OS) on lenvatinib, while delta-TLR serves as a predictor of response.<sup>58</sup> It also plays a role in assessing response to treatment by highlighting residual tumor tissue after TACE.<sup>59</sup>\n\nFOLLOWING CONTEXT:\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n6    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Explant histology can help identify patients with unfavorable prognoses due to poorly differentiated HCC or microvascular invasion. However, some centers have started using preoperative liver biopsy to guide liver transplantation (LT). The extended Toronto criteria allow LT for patients with tumors of any size or number, provided they do not exhibit systemic cancer-related symptoms, extrahepatic disease, vascular invasion, or poorly differentiated tumors on preoperative liver biopsy.<sup>60</sup>\n\nThe development of HCC involves the gradual accumulation of molecular changes that contribute to various molecular and cellular events. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have made it easier to examine the molecular landscapes of HCC. Recent research highlights the significance of the tumor microenvironment and cancer metabolism in HCC development.<sup>61</sup> Despite advancements in understanding HCC's molecular pathogenesis and identification of potential biomarkers, their translation into clinical practice is challenging. The main issues are variability in biomarker expression, lack of large-scale validation studies, difficulty in obtaining liver biopsy samples, and challenges in correlating these markers with clinical outcomes.<sup>62</sup> Furthermore, standardized, cost-effective techniques for biomarker assessment in the clinical setting are lacking.<sup>63</sup> Therefore, the routine testing of molecular/genetic signatures for HCC in blood or liver cannot currently be recommended for clinical practice.\n\n## INASL-BCLC Staging: The Recommended HCC Staging for India\n\nStaging is crucial in the management of all cancers as it enables the assessment and description of the tumor burden within the primary organ and its spread throughout the body. An ideal staging system should provide an accurate prognostic stratification and guide the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic approach based on the stage. Additionally, the staging system should facilitate the homogeneous grouping of patients in clinical trials and facilitate scientific research.\n\nThe Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system<sup>64</sup> is widely recognized as a prognostic tool for HCC. It effectively categorizes the severity of HCC and offers a reliable assessment of a patient's prognosis and suitable treatment options. Numerous studies have demonstrated the strong predictive value of BCLC staging for survival outcomes, highlighting its importance in the evaluation and management of HCC patients.\n\nThe 2022 BCLC guidelines have undergone further updates specifically targeting intermediate-stage HCC (BCLC-B) and systemic therapy options for advanced-stage HCC (BCLC-C).<sup>65</sup> The guidelines recommend systemic therapy for patients with diffuse, infiltrative, and extensive bilobar liver involvement. A novel concept called treatment stage migration (TSM) has been introduced in these guidelines, allowing for personalized treatment decisions based on clinical judgment when first-line treatment is not feasible due to patient characteristics. These updates emphasize the importance of individualized treatment approaches tailored to each patient's specific needs.<sup>66</sup>\n\nDespite the updates, the 2022 BCLC staging system has several limitations that need to be addressed.<sup>66\u201370</sup> The INASL taskforce has modified the existing BCLC staging system and recommends the use of the 'INASL modification of the BCLC staging system (INASL-BCLC\n\nFOLLOWING CONTEXT:\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Hepatocellular carcinoma<br/>in patients with liver cirrhosis]\n    \n    A --> B[Very early stage 0<br/>Single nodule \u22642 cm<br/>Preserved liver<br/>function CTP \u22646<br/>ECOG PS 0]\n    A --> C[Early stage...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87c34566-5717-489b-bc6f-2a119c449130": {"__data__": {"id_": "87c34566-5717-489b-bc6f-2a119c449130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"doc_id": "doc_7", "page_number": 8, "content_type": "diagram", "section": "general", "source": "inasl_guidelines", "token_count": 1597, "has_table": false, "has_image_desc": true, "char_count": 6191, "has_context": true, "is_summary": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "...pecific needs.<sup>66</sup>\n\nDespite the updates, the 2022 BCLC staging system has several limitations that need to be addressed.<sup>66\u201370</sup> The INASL taskforce has modified the existing BCLC staging system and recommends the use of the 'INASL modification of the BCLC staging system (INASL-BCLC\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Hepatocellular carcinoma<br/>in patients with liver cirrhosis]\n    \n    A --> B[Very early stage 0<br/>Single nodule \u22642 cm<br/>Preserved liver<br/>function CTP \u22646<br/>ECOG PS 0]\n    A --> C[Early stage A<br/>Single nodule >2 cm but <5 cm or<br/>2-3 nodules each \u22643 cm within<br/>Milan criteria<br/>Preserved liver function CTP \u22646<br/>ECOG PS 0]\n    A --> D[Intermediate stage B<br/>Multinodular or single nodule \u22655 cm<br/>beyond Milan criteria, or infiltrative<br/>Moderately preserved liver function<br/>CTP \u22648<br/>ECOG PS \u22641]\n    A --> E[Advanced stage C<br/>Portal invasion and/or<br/>extrahepatic spread<br/>Moderately preserved<br/>liver function CTP \u22648<br/>ECOG PS \u22642]\n    A --> F[Terminal stage D<br/>End-stage liver<br/>function CTP \u22659]\n    \n    B --> G[Potential candidate for<br/>liver transplantation]\n    G --> H{Decision}\n    H -->|No| I[Ablation]\n    H -->|Yes| J[Optimal surgical candidate<br/>for resection portal<br/>pressure, bilirubin]\n    \n    C --> K[Stage A1<br/>Single nodule<br/>of >2 cm]\n    C --> L[Stage A2<br/>2-3 nodules each<br/>\u22643 cm]\n    \n    J --> M{Decision}\n    M -->|Yes| N[Resection]\n    M -->|No| O{Contraindications<br/>to LT or if LT not<br/>available}\n    O -->|Yes| P[Ablation]\n    O -->|No| Q[Transplantation]\n    \n    D --> R[Stage B1<br/>Extended LT<br/>criteria]\n    D --> S[Stage B2<br/>Beyond<br/>extended LT<br/>criteria, well-<br/>defined<br/>nodules,<br/>preserved<br/>portal flow]\n    D --> T[Stage B3<br/>Diffuse,<br/>infiltrative,<br/>extensive<br/>bilobar liver<br/>involvement]\n    \n    S --> U{If LT is not<br/>available}\n    U --> V[Preferably<br/>downstage if<br/>beyond UCSF]\n    V --> Q\n    \n    R --> W[TACE/TARE<br/>\u00b1SBRT]\n    T --> X[TARE<br/>if feasible]\n    \n    E --> Y[Stage C1<br/>Portal vein invasion<br/>without any other<br/>extrahepatic spread]\n    E --> Z[Stage C2<br/>Extrahepatic<br/>spread]\n    \n    Y --> AA[TARE/SBRT/Resection<br/>if feasible]\n    \n    W --> AB[Systemic therapy]\n    X --> AB\n    AA --> AB\n    Z --> AB\n    \n    F --> AC[Stage D1<br/>Tumor within UCSF<br/>criteria and ECOG PS<br/>\u22642]\n    F --> AD[Stage D2<br/>Tumor beyond<br/>transplant criteria or<br/>ECOG PS >2]\n    \n    AB --> AE[Transplantation]\n    AB --> AF[Best supportive care]\n```\n\n**Figure 1** The 'INASL modification of BCLC staging' (INASL-BCLC) for prognosis prediction and treatment of HCC.

One shortcoming of the BCLC system is its ambiguity regarding the presence of underlying liver disease, merely mentioning HCC at the outset. The INASL-BCLC system provides clarity by specifically stating that the staging system applies to HCC patients with liver cirrhosis. The BCLC system lacks subdivisions in the advanced stage (BCLC-C) and terminal stage (BCLC-D). In contrast, the INASL-BCLC staging subdivides these stages to cater to the diverse patient population better. The stage C subdivision (C1 and C2) acknowledges the role of locoregional therapy in stage C1 patients. The subdivision of stage D into D1 and D2 allows for potential liver transplantation in patients with advanced liver disease but whose tumors still fit transplantation criteria (stage D1).<sup>71,72</sup> Additionally, the BCLC staging system does not account for the role of combination or adjuvant therapies. The revised INASL-BCLC staging recognizes the emerging importance of these therapies,<sup>73</sup> expanding the indication of systemic therapy to patients receiving locoregional therapy. The BCLC system also does not consider downstaging. However, the INASL-BCLC system indicates downstaging for tumors beyond the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria in patients with stage B1. Finally, the BCLC staging does not include the role of Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), both of which have been incorporated in the INASL-BCLC staging in light of strong supporting evidence. Thus, the revised INASL-BCLC staging system addresses several limitations of the BCLC staging system, offering a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to HCC management (Table 2).\n\n## Treatment Stage Migration\n\nTreatment stage migration (TSM), also known as treatment sequence or pattern of therapy, refers to the transition of a patient from one treatment modality to another due to disease progression or treatment failure. TSM occurs when a patient's profile prompts a shift in the recommended treatment to a modality that is typically prioritized for a more advanced stage of the disease. In the context of HCC, TSM usually involves the shift from curative treatment options (resection, ablation, liver transplantation [LT]) to palliative treatment options (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], transarterial radioembolization [TARE], stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT]), or from locoregional therapies to systemic therapy options.\n\nThe concept of TSM can also be applied in reverse, where a change in patient condition, often due to therapeutic intervention, makes them eligible for treatments that were previously not feasible. For example, if a patient initially presents with poor liver function and advanced HCC, they might be treated initially with best supportive care (such as treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, low albumin etc.). If these treatments lead to improved liver function, and potentially an improvement in liver function, the patient could then `migrate\u00b4 to an earlier treatment stage, such as systemic treatment or locoregional therapy.\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxx    7\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n## Table 2 Comparison of BCLC Staging and INASL Modification of BCLC Staging.\n\n| Criteria for Comparison                   | BCLC Staging                                                                   | INASL-BCLC Staging                                                        ...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a70e967-41f0-4dc0-9fae-4f389a88569b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a70e967-41f0-4dc0-9fae-4f389a88569b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"doc_id": "doc_8", "page_number": 9, "content_type": "diagram_with_table", "section": "table 2 comparison of bclc staging and inasl modification of bclc staging.", "source": "inasl_guidelines", "token_count": 1065, "has_table": true, "has_image_desc": true, "char_count": 6917, "has_context": true, "is_summary": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "...    7\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n## Table 2 Comparison of BCLC Staging and INASL Modification of BCLC Staging.\n\n| Criteria for Comparison                   | BCLC Staging                                                                   | INASL-BCLC Staging                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Consideration of Underlying Liver Disease | Initial condition only mentions HCC.                                           | Initial condition explicitly mentions HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis.                                                                                                                      |\n| Division of Stage C                       | No subdivision of advanced stage BCLC-C (PVTT and EHM).                        | INASL-BCLC stage C is subdivided into stages C1 and C2 to allow for the role of locoregional therapy in stage C1.                                                                                |\n| Division of Stage D                       | Terminal stage is a single, undivided stage; only offers best supportive care. | INASL-BCLC stage D is subdivided into stages D1 and D2.

Additionally, these approaches will be tailored to the specific context of the Indian setting.\n\n## Management of Patients of INASL-BCLC Stage B1: Role of Liver Transplantation\n\nStage B1, according to the INASL-BCLC staging system, is characterized by multifocal HCC that surpasses the INASL-BCLC-A criteria. Patients in this stage exhibit moderately preserved liver function (Child\u2013Turcotte\u2013Pugh score [CTP] \u22648), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u22641, and no signs of vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Within this group, there are patients with well-defined HCC nodules who may be eligible for liver transplantation if they fulfil various 'Extended Liver Transplant criteria', such as University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria,<sup>79</sup> Up-to-Seven criteria,<sup>80</sup> Metroticket 2.0 criteria,<sup>81</sup> Kyoto criteria,<sup>82</sup> Toronto criteria,<sup>83</sup> and Pittsburgh criteria<sup>84</sup> etc (Table 3). These extended criteria may be applied in association with downstaging (see below). If however, LT is not available, these patients should undergo TACE/TARE (with or without SBRT).\n\n**Patients within the UCSF criteria:** While the Milan criteria<sup>42</sup> have traditionally served as the standard for patient selection in liver transplantation, they can be overly stringent in the context of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Studies have shown that a slight deviation from the Milan criteria in terms of tumor size or number can still yield comparable survival rates.<sup>85</sup> The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria have emerged as the most validated expanded criteria, allowing for broader selection without compromising outcomes.<sup>86</sup> Therefore, INASL recommends the use of UCSF criteria for patient selection for LT, and patients who meet these criteria should be considered as candidates for upfront LT.\n\nNumerous retrospective and prospective studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate the superiority of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi)-based immunosuppression compared to mTORi-free immunosuppression following LT for HCC. The primary benefit of these agents is their association with enhanced post-LT survival and decreased tumor recurrence in HCC patients.<sup>87</sup> It's typically advised to avoid starting mTOR inhibitors within the first 30 days following transplant due to an elevated risk of complications such as hepatic artery thrombosis, issues with wound healing, proteinuria, and interstitial pneumonitis during the postoperative period.\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                             | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| INASL recommends the use of the UCSF criteria for patient selection for LT, and patients who meet these criteria should be considered for upfront LT. | Moderate          | Strong                     |\n| INASL recommends the use of mTORi-based immunosuppression rather than mTORi-free immunosuppression after LT for HCC.                                  | High              | Strong                     |\n\n\n**Table 3 The Milan Criteria and the Extended Liver Transplant Criteria.**\n\n| Criteria                   | Tumor Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Milan Criteria42           | Single tumor \u22645 cm OR up to three tumors each \u22643 cm                                                                                                                                       |\n| UCSF Criteria79            | Single tumor \u22646.5 cm OR up to three tumors with the largest being \u22644.5 cm, total tumor diameter \u22648 cm                                                                                     |\n| Up-to-Seven Criteria80     | Sum of the size of the largest tumor (in cm) and the number of tumors \u22647                                                                                                                  |\n| Metroticket 2.0 Criteria81 | Total tumor diameter \u22649 cm, regardless of the number of nodules, without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread                                                                    |\n| Kyoto Criteria82           | 10 or fewer tumors each \u22645 cm, serum des-\u03b3-carboxy prothrombin level \u2264400 mAU/mL                                                                                                          |\n| Toronto Criteria83         | No macrovascular invasion, sum of the size of the largest tumor and the number of tumors \u226418                                                                                              |\n| Pittsburgh Criteria84      | Single tumor \u22645 cm OR 2\u20133 tumors each \u22643 cm, and no vascular invasion or distant metastases, along with a low level of proliferative activity of the tumor (based on Ki67 labeling index) |\n\n\n**Patients beyond the UCSF criteria: role of downstaging and tumor biology:** Patients classified as INASL-BCLC stage B1 who are beyond the UCSF criteria but fulfil other expanded criteria for LT, with no extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion, should preferably undergo downstaging before considering living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).

The most recent guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)<sup>62</sup>, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD),<sup>89,90</sup> and International Liver Transplantation Society (ILTS)<sup>91</sup> recommend that patients who exceed the Milan or UCSF criteria or are in T3 stage should only undergo liver transplantation after successful downstaging to meet the Milan criteria. According to a retrospective analysis patients beyond UCSF criteria who underwent downstaging had a high 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates (80%, 79%, and 75%, respectively), suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.<sup>92</sup> In another LDLT study patients who were successfully downstaged to fit UCSF criteria the overall 1- and 5-year survival rates were comparable; 94.1% versus 92.7% and 83.7% versus 78.9% of downstaged (beyond UCSF) versus non-downstaged (within UCSF), respectively.<sup>93</sup>\n\nThe University of California San Francisco (UCSF) downstaging protocol, introduced by Yao *et al.* in 2005, required that both the total tumor diameter and the size of a single lesion be less than 8 cm for enrollment. Patients with HCC who were successfully downstaged to meet the Milan criteria demonstrated comparable 5-year post-LT survival and intention-to-treat survival rates to the T2 HCC control group.<sup>94</sup> Additionally, excellent 10-year post-LT results in a large, multicenter cohort of patients who were successfully downstaged to meet the Milan criteria validated the downstaging strategies employed in the USA.<sup>95</sup> INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved. After downstaging, these patients should at least meet the UCSF criteria.\n\nAmong the various downstaging strategies, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely utilized, while transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has shown promise in downstaging patients with larger tumors and portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). Ablative therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have also demonstrated favorable downstaging outcomes.<sup>96,97</sup> Identifying a single superior downstaging modality proves challenging, as it depends on the individual case. Generally, an aggressive approach to locoregional therapies (LRTs) combined with appropriate patient selection offers the most effective downstaging results.<sup>98</sup>\n\nElevated levels of AFP are associated with reduced survival probability and an increased risk of HCC recurrence. Patients with tumors exceeding the Milan criteria but having an AFP level below 100 ng/mL exhibited a lower 5-year recurrence risk compared to those with AFP levels exceeding 1000 ng/mL.<sup>43</sup> Consequently, several centers have established a cut-off value of 1000 ng/dL, beyond which patients are typically excluded from LT. Although downstaging therapy can lead to a decline in AFP levels, there is currently no reliable data specifying the extent or duration of the decrease required before considering LT.\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Patients who are beyond the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, lack vascular invasion, and show no distant spread may undergo transplantation following successful downstaging, provided that the specified downstaging endpoints (both morphological and biological) are achieved.                                                                                                                                                                          | Moderate          | Strong                     |\n| In patients with multifocal HCC beyond UCSF criteria, with no extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion; LDLT may be considered in carefully selected patients who exhibit favorable tumor biology.

This suggests that these patients may benefit from the targeted delivery of therapies directly to the tumor site while preserving portal flow.\n\n**Role of TACE/TARE in patients with INASL-BCLC stage B2 or B1 not undergoing LT:** Patients with large or multinodular HCC in the intermediate stage (INASL-BCLC\n\nFOLLOWING CONTEXT:\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\nstage B2) and without available curative treatment options, such as ablation, resection, or transplantation, should be considered for TACE.<sup>99</sup> TACE is suitable for patients with moderately preserved liver function (Child-...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44bc0113-1852-4d7e-877d-0b11c411c950": {"__data__": {"id_": "44bc0113-1852-4d7e-877d-0b11c411c950", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"doc_id": "doc_11", "page_number": 12, "content_type": "table", "section": "general", "source": "inasl_guidelines", "token_count": 1385, "has_table": true, "has_image_desc": false, "char_count": 6660, "has_context": true, "is_split_table": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "PRECEDING CONTEXT:\n...suggests that these patients may benefit from the targeted delivery of therapies directly to the tumor site while preserving portal flow.\n\n**Role of TACE/TARE in patients with INASL-BCLC stage B2 or B1 not undergoing LT:** Patients with large or multinodular HCC in the intermediate stage (INASL-BCLC\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\nstage B2) and without available curative treatment options, such as ablation, resection, or transplantation, should be considered for TACE.<sup>99</sup> TACE is suitable for patients with moderately preserved liver function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score [CTP] \u22648) and a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] \u22641). TACE can also be utilized as a bridging or downstaging therapy prior to liver transplantation, aiming to achieve or maintain a limited intrahepatic tumor burden defined by the Milan/UCSF criteria. However, extensive extrahepatic metastases and tumor infiltration of the main portal vein are contraindications for TACE.\n\nTACE should be performed in a selective manner, aiming to achieve complete devascularization of the tumor tissue.<sup>99</sup> Both conventional TACE, which involves cytotoxic drugs, iodized oil, and embolic particles, and drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) have demonstrated similar efficacy. However, DEB-TACE allows for higher concentrations of drugs within the target tumor while maintaining lower systemic concentrations.<sup>100,101</sup> In a prospective single-center study from India, administration of N-acetyl cysteine to patients exhibiting post-TACE syndrome significantly reduced their transaminase levels, demonstrating a potential treatment for this common complication following TACE.<sup>102</sup>\n\nEvidence has consistently shown that TACE can lead to a reduction in tumor size and improved survival outcomes for HCC patients, whether they have solitary or multiple lesions.<sup>103</sup> Randomized controlled trials have further substantiated the efficacy of TACE by demonstrating long-term progression-free survival (PFS), improved overall survival (OS), and enhanced quality of life due to its ability to provide local control of the tumor.<sup>99</sup> Therefore, INASL recommends that HCC patients in INASL-BCLC stage B2, with preserved portal flow and a defined tumor burden, should be considered for intra-arterial locoregional therapies. Specifically, TACE should be recommended for these patients.\n\nRecent findings highlight that TARE utilizing Y<sup>90</sup> provides a significantly longer time to progression (TTP) compared to TACE, although OS does not significantly differ between the two treatments.<sup>104</sup> Therefore, the decision to employ Y<sup>90</sup>-TARE in patients with INASL-BCLC stage B2 should be tailored to each individual, taking into account factors such as cost and availability.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that in patients with early- and intermediate-stage HCCs larger than 5 cm, the combination of TACE with ablation resulted in a higher therapeutic response rate and longer OS compared to TACE alone.<sup>105-108</sup> Among the ablative modalities used in conjunction with TACE, microwave ablation (MWA) showed superior response rates compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for tumors ranging between 3 and 5 cm, while survival rates did not significantly differ between the two.<sup>109</sup> Furthermore, the\n\naddition of TACE to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has exhibited higher response rates, local control rates, and survival rates in comparison to SBRT alone.<sup>110</sup>\n\nThe use of systemic therapy as adjuvant therapy with TACE is discussed subsequently.\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| TACE is indicated for HCC patients with well-defined nodules and preserved portal flow in the following scenarios:<br/><br/>\u2022 INASL-BCLC stage B2<br/>\u2022 INASL-BCLC stage B1 patients who do not have the prospect of LT. | High              | Strong                     |\n| The use of Y90-TARE for INASL-BCLC Stage B1/B2 should be individualized.                                                                                                                                                 | Moderate          | Weak                       |\n| When combining TACE with ablation for tumors larger than 5 cm, it may be preferable to combine TACE with microwave ablation (MWA) rather than radiofrequency ablation (RFA).                                             | Low               | Weak                       |\n\n\n## Role of resection in highly selected patients of INASL-BCLC stages B1 and B2:\n\nMultiple observational studies<sup>111-115</sup> and one randomized controlled trial<sup>116</sup> have consistently demonstrated a survival advantage of liver resection (LR) over TACE for individuals with intermediate-stage HCC (BCLC-B). A recent meta-analysis revealed a 5-year OS rate of 54% for LR in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria.<sup>117</sup> Another meta-analysis showed that patients with BCLC stage B who underwent LR had a longer OS than those who underwent TACE.<sup>118</sup> Another systematic review revealed a 5-year OS of 33.5% for resection of HCC >10 cm, 41.7% for BCLC B, 23.3% for BCLC C, and 36.6% for multinodular HCC. Perioperative mortality ranged from 0 to 6.9%.<sup>119</sup> Furthermore, a large observational study specifically focusing on multinodular tumors (up to three lesions) indicated that LR provided improved 5-year OS compared to TACE, particularly for tumors larger than 3 cm.<sup>115</sup> In cases where patients meet the UCSF criteria but have no prospects for transplantation, hepatic resection with ablation has been attempted with acceptable results.<sup>120</sup> Patients with BCLC-B HCC may experience higher long-term survival rates with LR compared to TACE; however, careful selection of suitable candidates is crucial for minimizing perioperative morbidity rates.

According to the propensity score analysis, OS was substantially greater in the group that underwent resection, compared to the TACE group, with a hazard ratio of 3.17.<sup>121</sup>\n\nBefore performing a major hepatectomy in patients with cirrhotic liver, it is important to ensure a remnant liver volume of approximately 40%.<sup>122</sup> Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), characterized by a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) exceeding 10 mmHg, is associated with an increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality following liver resection.<sup>123</sup> INASL suggests that the feasibility of liver resection should be evaluated in intermediate-stage HCC patients who do not have CSPH, possess potentially resectable tumors, and have moderate residual liver function with a volume reserve of at least 40%.\n\nMajor guidelines for HCC do not recommend the use of adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy as there is limited evidence to support their efficacy in reducing the risk of recurrence following resection. However, neoadjuvant therapy utilizing locoregional therapies (LRTs) has shown promising results in improving prognosis compared to hepatectomy alone for patients with operable HCC.<sup>124,125</sup> One retrospective study found that preoperative TACE improved RFS and OS in patients with large HCC (\u226510 cm), but not in those with smaller tumors (5.0\u20139.9 cm).<sup>126</sup>\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| In patients with intermediate-stage HCC (INASL-BCLC stage B), the feasibility of liver resection should be evaluated in those without clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Specifically, consideration should be given to patients with potentially resectable tumors, moderate residual liver function, and an adequate volume reserve (future liver remnant - FLR - of at least 40%). | Moderate          | Weak                       |\n| Neoadjuvant therapy is not generally recommended as a routine approach prior to liver resection. However, in cases where resection is technically challenging, neoadjuvant therapy utilizing locoregional therapies (LRTs) may be considered to facilitate the resection process.                                                                                                                     | Moderate          | Weak                       |\n\n\n## *Management of INASL-BCLC Stage B3 and Stage C1*\n\nThe third subgroup of stage B in the INASL-BCLC classification, known as stage B3, encompasses patients with diffuse, infiltrative, or extensive liver involvement from HCC. In these cases, TACE is not recommended, and instead, systemic therapy with or without TARE should be considered as the recommended treatment approach.\n\nThe INASL-BCLC stage C1 comprises patients who exhibit vascular invasion, yet remain relatively fit with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of \u22642 and moderately preserved liver function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score [CTP] \u22648). In the majority of these patients, vascular invasion manifests as portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). In India, PVTT is reported in 40\u201346% of HCC patients.<sup>127,128</sup> PVTT can be classified into various categories based on specific criteria. The Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan's categorization<sup>129</sup> is among the more well-known ones, which categorized portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) into five grades (Figure 2): (1) Vp0, no PVTT; (2) Vp1, subsistence of PVTT not in, but distal to, the 2nd order branches of the portal vein; (3) Vp2, subsistence of PVTT in the 2nd order branches of the portal vein; (4) Vp3, subsistence of PVTT in the 1st order branches of the portal vein; and (5) Vp4, subsistence of PVTT in the main trunk of the portal vein or a portal vein branch contralateral to the mainly involved lobe (or both).<sup>130</sup> In addition to systemic therapy, patients with PVTT may benefit from transarterial radioembolization (TARE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), or resection depending on case-to-case basis.\n\n**Role of TARE in patients with INASL-BCLC stages B3 and C1:** While the general consensus deems TACE to be relatively contraindicated for patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), certain studies suggest otherwise. Some research findings propose that TACE can indeed demonstrate effective disease control and enhanced survival rates in HCC patients presenting with portal vein invasion, regardless of it typically being a relative contraindication.<sup>131,132</sup> Notwithstanding these findings, transarterial radioembolization (TARE) remains the generally preferred option for locoregional therapy in patients with PVTT.\n\nTARE using Yttrium-90 has gained increasing prominence as a treatment option for advanced or intermediate HCC.<sup>133</sup> TARE aims to induce microembolic effects, promoting radiation injury while preserving blood flow to the targeted liver segments. Radioembolic microspheres containing Yttrium-90 (Y<sup>90</sup>) are delivered through the hepatic artery in TARE, where they lodge at the arteriolar level and emit radiation through beta decay.<sup>133</sup> TARE using iodine-131 has also been used with good results.<sup>134</sup>\n\nInitially developed as a palliative care option for advanced HCC, TARE offers significant advantages as the\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\n| **Vp0**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/><br/>No PVTT                                        | **Vp1**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/>PVTT present<br/>distal to 2nd<br/>order branch           |\n| -------------------------------------------------...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebdf16fc-8504-49a3-9746-acf38519833d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebdf16fc-8504-49a3-9746-acf38519833d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"doc_id": "doc_13", "page_number": 14, "content_type": "diagram_with_table", "section": "general", "source": "inasl_guidelines", "token_count": 839, "has_table": true, "has_image_desc": true, "char_count": 3374, "has_context": true, "is_summary": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "...hepatic artery in TARE, where they lodge at the arteriolar level and emit radiation through beta decay.<sup>133</sup> TARE using iodine-131 has also been used with good results.<sup>134</sup>\n\nInitially developed as a palliative care option for advanced HCC, TARE offers significant advantages as the\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY\n\n| **Vp0**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/><br/>No PVTT                                        | **Vp1**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/>PVTT present<br/>distal to 2nd<br/>order branch           |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Vp2**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/>PVTT present in<br/>the 2nd order<br/>branch        | **Vp3**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/>PVTT present in<br/>the 1st order<br/>branch              |\n| **Vp4**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/><br/><br/>PVTT present in<br/>the main PV<br/>trunk | **Vp4**<br/><br/>Tumor<br/><br/>PVTT extends up to<br/>contralateral 1st<br/>order branch |\n\n\n**Figure 2** The Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan's classification for PVTT, which categorized PVTT into five grades: (1) Vp0, no PVTT; (2) Vp1, presence of PVTT not in, but distal to, the 2nd order branches of the portal vein; (3) Vp2, presence of PVTT in the 2nd order branches of the portal vein; (4) Vp3, presence of PVTT in the 1st order branches of the portal vein; and (5) Vp4, presence of PVTT in the main trunk of the portal vein or a portal vein branch contralateral to the mainly involved lobe (or both).

However, the tumor response rates were notably higher in the TARE arm, while there were no differences in progression-free survival (PFS). Fewer patients in the TARE group experienced significant side-effects compared to the sorafenib group. These trials were the first to establish the safety and efficacy of TARE in treating patients with locally advanced HCC, demonstrating its superior tolerability and greater tumor response compared to sorafenib.<sup>135,136</sup> In patients with inoperable multilobar HCC undergoing TARE, high lung shunt fraction, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were identified as independent predictors of poor overall survival (OS), according to a retrospective analysis from India.<sup>137</sup> Total lesion glycolysis is a parameter that incorporates both the degree of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake and the amount of metabolically active tumor volume on pretreatment <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT.\n\nMoreover, Y<sup>90</sup>-TARE can be employed as a downstaging therapy for patients with advanced HCC whose disease\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxx    13\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n14                                    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

While most studies have utilized a 5\u20136 fraction schedule, recent trials have explored the use of 3 fraction schedules, which have demonstrated similar rates of local control. However, the impact of higher doses on treatment outcomes remains unknown.<sup>150</sup>\n\nStudies have indicated that SBRT achieves superior 2-year local control rates compared to transarterial chemoembolization [TACE] (91% vs. 23%),<sup>151</sup> while demonstrating similar survival rates.<sup>151,152</sup> Ongoing studies are currently evaluating the efficacy of combination of TACE plus SBRT for unresectable HCC. Consequently, INASL recommends SBRT as an option for patients with INASL-BCLC stage B who are ineligible for surgery, unable to undergo TACE/ transarterial radioembolization\n\n[TARE], or have residual/recurrent disease following TACE/TARE, aiming to achieve local disease control.\n\nSBRT has been proven to deliver long-lasting local control in patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).<sup>150,153\u2013155</sup> In a randomized trial comparing the combination of TACE and SBRT to sorafenib in individuals with HCC and PVTT, TACE plus SBRT exhibited superior progression-free survival, longer time to progression, and improved overall survival (OS).<sup>156</sup> Another study investigated the long-term effects of SBRT in patients with HCC and PVT, revealing a one-year local control rate of 87.4% and a median OS of 18.3 months when a dosage of 27\u201354 Gy was administered in 5 fractions.<sup>157</sup> One Indian study revealed that SBRT significantly reduced the volume, enhancement, and major axis length of PVTT in HCC patients, and no case of radiation-induced liver disease was observed after the treatment.<sup>158</sup> In another Indian study, the rates of local control, PFS, and OS after one year were found to be 95%, 53.4%, and 60%, respectively. The total incidence of grade III toxicity was observed to be less than 5%, with lymphocytopenia emerging as the most frequently occurring adverse effect.<sup>155</sup> Therefore, INASL recommends that SBRT be considered as an option for patients with advanced-stage HCC and PVTT, as it can potentially offer a survival advantage when used in conjunction with systemic therapies or TARE as deemed appropriate.\n\nThe use of systemic therapy as adjuvant therapy with SBRT is discussed later.\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| SBRT is a viable option for achieving local control in patients with intermediate stage HCC (INASL-BCLC stage B) who are not eligible for surgery, unable to undergo TACE/TARE, or experiencing residual/recurrent disease following TACE/TARE.  | Moderate          | Weak                       |\n| SBRT is a viable option for patients diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC with PVTT (INASL-BCLC stage C1) and has been shown to offer a survival advantage for these individuals.

Extrahepatic metastasis (EHM) is reported to be present in approximately 25% of patients.<sup>159</sup> Patients in this stage are candidates for systemic therapies, such as targeted therapies or immunotherapy, depending on individual patient characteristics and available treatment options.<sup>65</sup> The role of systemic therapy in the overall management of HCC is further described in the subsequent sections.\n\n**Stagewise indications of systemic therapy (in intermediate and advanced HCC setting):** Patients with advanced-stage HCC can potentially benefit from systemic therapies, which involve the administration of drugs orally or intravenously to target cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic therapies for HCC include molecular targeted therapy, which aims to disrupt intracellular signals involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, as well as immunotherapy, which enhances the body's immune system to fight against cancer cells.<sup>160</sup> Cytotoxic chemotherapy is rarely used for HCC. Currently, systemic therapies such as molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, a type of immunotherapy, are employed in the treatment of HCC. The primary objective of systemic therapy is typically to improve OS and PFS in select cases.\n\nSystemic therapy plays an important role in the treatment of HCC based on the stage and eligibility criteria outlined by INASL. The current indications for systemic therapy as the sole therapy for HCC include INASL-BCLC stage C2 and INASL-BCLC stage B3/C1 patients who are not undergoing transarterial radioembolization (TARE), as well as INASL-BCLC stage B1/B2 patients who are refractory to or ineligible for locoregional or surgical therapy. Systemic therapy can also be considered as a potential treatment option for patients who have experienced progression after receiving locoregional therapy, SBRT, or a combination of systemic and locoregional therapy/SBRT. This approach may provide an alternative treatment strategy for these patients.\n\nIncreasing evidence indicates that immunotherapy, particularly the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, may serve as a pivotal shift in the management of HCC. By integrating these therapies with locoregional treatment, there is potential to enhance the rates of recurrence and overall survival for HCC patients.<sup>161</sup> Thus, INASL suggests the use of systemic therapy as adjuvant therapy with TACE, TARE, or SBRT in patients with INASL-BCLC stage B, and with TARE, SBRT, or resection in patients with INASL-BCLC stage C1<sup>161</sup>. Systemic therapy can also be combined with locoregional therapy for downstaging prior to liver transplantation. However, there is no indication for the use of systemic therapy as adjuvant therapy with liver transplantation. It is important to note that systemic therapy is not recommended for patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores [CTP] \u22659).\n\nA meta-analysis of 13 mainly retrospective studies found that adjuvant sorafenib therapy after resection in patients with HCC was associated with improved overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and reduced recurrence rates compared to control.<sup>162</sup> However, an RCT involving 1114 patients who underwent surgical resection or local ablation showed no significant difference in median recurrence-free survival between the sorafenib and placebo groups. The study concluded that sorafenib is ineffective as an adjuvant therapy following resection or ablation for HCC.<sup>163</sup>\n\nThe TACTICS trial compared TACE plus sorafenib with TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC. It demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly improved median PFS compared to TACE alone. However, there was no significant difference in median overall survival between the two groups. The trial suggested that TACE plus sorafenib could be considered as a treatment option for intermediate-stage HCC, particularly in patients with high tumor burden.<sup>164,165</sup> An Indian study found that combining TACE with sorafenib significantly improved disease control, time to progression, and OS in patients with advanced-stage HCC compared to TACE alone, without significantly increasing adverse reactions.<sup>166</sup> A meta-analysis of 30 studies found that TACE combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was superior to TACE alone in terms of prolonging time to progression (TTP), OS, and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with unresectable HCC, although it was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events such as hand-foot skin reactions, diarrhea, and hypertension.<sup>167</sup>\n\nA meta-analysis of 9 studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding sorafenib to TARE for HCC treatment. The analysis found no significant difference in overall survival and progression-free survival between the combined therapy and TARE alone. The authors concluded that the addition of sorafenib to radioembolization does not appear to improve survival or delay disease progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup>168</sup>\n\nAccording to current evidence, genetic and serum biomarkers for predicting the response of HCC to systemic therapy are not recommended for routine clinical use due to insufficient data.

has been the standard of care for patients with advanced HCC (INASL-BCLC stage C), demonstrating significant improvements in median overall survival and time to progression compared to placebo, as shown in the SHARP trial and the Asia\u2013Pacific trial.<sup>171,172</sup> However, common adverse events like hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, and hypertension have been associated with Sorafenib. On the other hand, lenvatinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor with a unique inhibitory profile against fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1\u20134, along with other targets like vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), RET, and KIT, has been shown to be non-inferior in terms of overall survival (OS) while offering significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) compared to Sorafenib in advanced HCC patients. The REFLECT trial (a Phase 3 non-inferiority trial) demonstrated these findings and reported that Lenvatinib is generally well-tolerated, with manageable side-effects such as hypertension, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss, though it also carries common adverse events like hypertension and proteinuria.<sup>173</sup> However, it's important to note that while both drugs' individual benefits have been demonstrated the choice between Lenvatinib and Sorafenib could be influenced by factors like the patient's overall health status, potential drug interactions, side-effect profiles, and cost.\n\nSince 2008, sorafenib has been the only approved treatment for advanced HCC (INASL-BCLC stage C), showing improved survival compared to placebo.<sup>171,172</sup> Lenvatinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, has been shown to have non-inferior OS and significantly longer PFS and time to progression (TTP) compared to sorafenib in advanced HCC patients.<sup>173</sup> However, lenvatinib is associated with common adverse events such as hypertension and proteinuria, highlighting the importance of appropriate management to ensure continued systemic therapy.\n\nThe treatment algorithm has been redefined due to advancements in systemic therapies, offering novel agents for advanced and intermediate-stage HCC (Table 4). Atezolizumab is a completely humanized, engineered IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to PD-L1.<sup>174</sup> Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab demonstrated significant improvements in OS and PFS in advanced HCC patients in the IMbrave 150 study.<sup>175</sup> However, this combination therapy was associated with adverse events such as hypertension and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

However, the study concludes that careful candidate selection is crucial, especially limiting the use of this combination therapy in patients with CTP C, to optimize patient outcomes and ensure treatment safety.<sup>177</sup> Tremelimumab plus durvalumab showed promising efficacy in a phase 3 trial (HIMALAYA), with significant improvement in OS over sorafenib, while durvalumab monotherapy was non-inferior to sorafenib.<sup>178</sup> The choice between atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atez/Bev) and tremelimumab plus durvalumab (Dur/Tre) as first-line treatment for advanced HCC depends on factors such as tolerability of anti-VEGF therapy, tumor burden, WNT/\u03b2-catenin mutation status, and HCC etiology.<sup>179</sup> However, tremelimumab is currently unavailable in India, and the high cost of immune checkpoint inhibitors poses a significant financial burden for Indian patients. The COSMIC-312 trial did not demonstrate an improvement in OS with cabozantinib plus atezolizumab compared to sorafenib for first-line treatment of advanced HCC.<sup>180</sup> Similarly, the Checkmate 459 trial showed a trend towards improved OS with nivolumab monotherapy compared to sorafenib in treatment-na\u00efve patients, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.<sup>181</sup>\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider that the use of Bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic drugs should be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disorders, recent bleeding, or untreated high-risk esophageal varices. In cases where these treatment regimens are required for patients with large esophageal varices, primary endoscopic variceal ligation should be performed for variceal eradication. While immunotherapy has emerged as an important treatment option for HCC, meta-analyses have shown that patients with HCC related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are less likely to benefit from ICIs alone, and the addition of angiogenesis inhibitors may be necessary to enhance their response to ICIs.<sup>182</sup> A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that treatments containing ICIs were more effective in improving OS in males, patients with macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread, and those with viral-related HCC.<sup>183</sup> Notably, cytotoxic chemotherapy, either as monotherapy or in combination, did not show significant improvement in overall survival for advanced HCC patients.\n\nThe choice of second-line systemic therapy in HCC depends on the type of first-line treatment. If Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is unsuccessful as the first-line therapy, a TKI such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, or regorafenib may be recommended as second-line therapy.<sup>90</sup> However, if sorafenib or lenvatinib fails as the first-line treatment, second-line therapy with cabozantinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab (for patients with AFP \u2265400 ng/mL), or atezolizumab-bevacizumab may be considered for eligible patients. Additionally, pembrolizumab or nivolumab are reasonable second-line options for suitable candidates.<sup>90</sup> The KEYNOTE-\n\n**18**    **\u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Events (CTCAE) v5.0, which consists of 5 grades (Table 5).<sup>185</sup> Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to cause AEs in more than 15% of patients, with severity ranging from grade 1 to grade 4<sup>186</sup>. Patients experiencing grade 1\u20132 AEs should not have their medication changed, while those with grade 3 AEs should have the TKI withheld until symptoms improve and liver function tests indicate grade 1 or less before reintroducing the medication. In cases of grade 4 toxicity, the TKI should be discontinued. It is important to implement preventive and specific management strategies tailored to different adverse events.<sup>186</sup>\n\n*(Continued on next page)*\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxx19\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nINASL HCC GUIDELINES 2023    KUMAR ET AL\n\n## Systemic therapy\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Systemic therapy] --> B[Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab]\n    A --> C[Lenvatinib]\n    A --> D[Sorafenib]\n    A --> E[Tremelimumab-Durvalumab]\n    A --> F[Durvalumab]\n    \n    B --> G[Sorafenib or Len...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbed2a3b-8324-464a-9aa8-23f20e5f6d1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbed2a3b-8324-464a-9aa8-23f20e5f6d1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"doc_id": "doc_20", "page_number": 21, "content_type": "diagram_with_table", "section": "systemic therapy", "source": "inasl_guidelines", "token_count": 1133, "has_table": true, "has_image_desc": true, "char_count": 5036, "has_context": true, "is_summary": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "...xx19\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nINASL HCC GUIDELINES 2023    KUMAR ET AL\n\n## Systemic therapy\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Systemic therapy] --> B[Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab]\n    A --> C[Lenvatinib]\n    A --> D[Sorafenib]\n    A --> E[Tremelimumab-Durvalumab]\n    A --> F[Durvalumab]\n    \n    B --> G[Sorafenib or Lenvatinib or Cabozantinib or Regorafenib]\n    C --> H[Cabozantinib or Regorafenib or Ramucirumab AFP \u2265400 or Atez/Bev or Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab]\n    D --> I[Cabozantinib or Regorafenib or Ramucirumab AFP \u2265400 or Atez/Bev or Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab]\n```\n\n**First-line:**\n- Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab\n- Lenvatinib\n- Sorafenib\n- Tremelimumab-Durvalumab\n- Durvalumab\n\n**Second-line:**\n- Sorafenib or Lenvatinib or Cabozantinib or Regorafenib\n- Cabozantinib or Regorafenib or Ramucirumab (AFP \u2265400) or Atez/Bev or Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab\n- Cabozantinib or Regorafenib or Ramucirumab (AFP \u2265400) or Atez/Bev or Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab\n\n**Notes:**\n1.

In cases of grade 2 ILICI, the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) should be temporarily withheld until symptoms improve and liver function tests indicate grade 1 or less. If symptoms persist for more than 7 days, low-dose steroids should be administered. Grade 3 or 4 ILICI requires discontinuation of the ICI, and high-dose steroids should be used until symptoms and liver function tests (LFTs) normalize to grade 1 or less, followed by a gradual tapering over 4 weeks. If there is no improvement with steroids, other immunosuppressive agents should be considered.<sup>189</sup> It is worth noting that the development of ILICI or other immune-related adverse events may be associated with improved efficacy of immunotherapy, resulting in favorable response rates and prolonged survival. Resuming ICI therapy after the resolution of adverse events does not appear to impact the efficacy of ICI therapy in controlling HCC.<sup>190</sup>\n\nIn an Indian study that assessed the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab-bevacizumab as a first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC, it was found that while the\n\n20    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

This recurrence often hinges on pre-transplant tumor attributes like size, number, and vascular involvement. For a reliable prediction of HCC recurrence risk post-liver transplantation, both pre- and post-transplant variables should be considered. The use of predictive models that include these variables can help evaluate the probability of HCC recurrence and support the formulation of post-transplant management plans.<sup>195</sup>\n\nThe Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant (RETREAT) score has been developed as a tool to estimate the risk of tumor recurrence after LT for HCC. The RETREAT score incorporates factors such as AFP levels, presence of microvascular invasion, and the sum of the largest viable tumor size and number of tumors on the explanted liver. By considering these factors, the RETREAT score provides valuable information to assess the likelihood of HCC recurrence after LT.<sup>196</sup>\n\nTo minimize the risk of HCC recurrence, it is important to maintain an optimally low level of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), which are commonly used immunosuppressive medications in LT. Studies have shown that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help reduce the risk of HCC recurrence post-LT.<sup>197</sup> Therefore, in HCC patients with a high risk of recurrence following LT, a combination therapy of low-dose CNIs and mTOR inhibitors should be considered. This approach may contribute to improved outcomes by minimizing the risk of HCC recurrence.\n\nPost-transplant surveillance plays a crucial role in the early detection of recurrent HCC following LT.<sup>198</sup> To effectively monitor for recurrence, a combination of AFP and either contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen and chest or FDG PET imaging is recommended. It is important to note that patients who were transplanted within the Milan criteria do not require routine surveillance.<sup>62</sup> However, for patients who were transplanted beyond the Milan criteria or those with other high-risk features identified during explant evaluation, close surveillance is highly recommended.<sup>42</sup>\n\nThe frequency of post-transplant surveillance should be every 3\u20136 months during the first two years and then every 6 months for the subsequent five years.<sup>62</sup> This regular monitoring allows for timely detection of any recurrent HCC, enabling prompt intervention and treatment.\n\n| Statement

This concept is particularly relevant in cases of advanced HCC, where factors such as tumor burden and underlying liver dysfunction strongly influence treatment response and patient outcomes. Untreatable progression represents treatment failure or disease progression that occurs within the patient's initial BCLC stage, despite the selected treatment strategy.\n\nA comprehensive evaluation involving a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including medical oncologists, hepatologists, radiologists, and palliative care specialists, is essential in determining the futility of treatment. The team should consider a range of factors, including tumor burden, extent of liver dysfunction, overall patient health, and care objectives. This collective assessment helps guide clinical decision-making regarding the appropriateness and potential benefits of continued treatment for patients with advanced HCC.\n\n## Criteria of Futility of Specific Treatments\n\nLT is considered a potential curative option for patients with early-stage HCC or selected cases of intermediate-stage HCC. However, the success of LT in HCC patients can be limited by several factors.<sup>202</sup> Advanced HCC, characterized by large tumor size, multiple tumors, vascular invasion, and extrahepatic metastasis, is associated with a high rate of tumor recurrence and poor survival outcomes,\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxx23\n\nPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n24    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Patients with high-risk features for tumor recurrence, such as AFP levels or poorly differentiated tumors, may not be suitable candidates for LT.<sup>203</sup> Furthermore, patients with underlying medical conditions or comorbidities may have an increased risk of post-transplant complications, which can limit the feasibility of LT.<sup>202,204</sup>\n\nThere are certain criteria and contraindications for LT in HCC. Elderly patients over 70, those with significant non-liver morbidities, extrahepatic disease, or main portal vein or hepatic vein tumor thrombus are generally not recommended for LT. LT outside of the established criteria may not be effective unless successful downstaging is achieved. A five-year survival rate of less than 60% is typically considered a threshold indicating that LT may not be a worthwhile intervention. However, exceptions to these guidelines may be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially for patients with HCC and advanced cirrhosis, as LT can potentially improve survival rates. It is important to note that LT is a costly and resource-intensive procedure that requires prolonged hospital care. Therefore, careful patient selection and evaluation are essential to determine which HCC patients are most likely to benefit from LT. From an oncologist's perspective, LT may be justified in cases of advanced cirrhosis with HCC, but it is important to consider expected cure rates exceeding 60% in terms of five-year survival when recommending LT.<sup>202,203</sup>\n\nIn addition to LT, locoregional therapies (LRT) is a commonly used treatment modality for advanced liver disease. However, there are certain situations where LRT may be considered futile. For instance, patients with decompensated liver disease, indicated by a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 9 or higher, may not be suitable candidates for LRT. Similarly, if a patient shows no response or experiences disease progression following a specific LRT procedure such as TACE, further attempts at the same procedure may be deemed futile.<sup>205</sup> If LRT is expected to result in persistent decompensation of liver disease, it is considered futile. Likewise, any worsening of liver decompensation following an LRT procedure should be regarded as an indication of futility for subsequent procedures. Additionally, systemic therapies may not be effective in patients with poor liver function, specifically those classified as Child B or C with a CTP score of \u22659, or in patients with a poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score of 3\u20134).\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |\n| LT may be considered futile in the following situations:<br/>\u2022 Elderly (>70)<br/>\u2022 Significant non-liver morbidity<br/>\u2022 Extrahepatic disease<br/>\u2022 Main Portal vein or hepatic vein tumor thrombus<br/>\u2022 Deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) outside UCSF criteria<br/>\u2022 Expected five-year survival rate of <60%.<br/>However, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis. | Moderate          | Strong                     |\n| It is important to preserve liver function when selecting candidates for locoregional therapies (LRT).

This may involve implementing supportive measures to address pain, nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with advanced HCC, as well as providing emotional and spiritual support to the patient and their family.\n\nThe optimal management of pain is crucial, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ladder should be utilized as necessary, while avoiding the use of hepatotoxic drugs.<sup>206</sup> Palliative radiotherapy is recommended for patients experiencing painful bone metastases. In addition to pain control, appropriate nutritional intervention should be provided to all patients. Psychological support should also be made available, but the use of psychoactive drugs and benzodiazepines should be avoided due to increased adverse effects. Timely counseling for the family and effective communication about outcomes are also essential. These measures collectively contribute to a comprehensive approach to palliative care.<sup>207</sup>\n\n| Statement | Level of evidence | Strength of recommendation |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Optimal pain control should be achieved by utilizing the WHO ladder when necessary and avoiding the use of hepatotoxic drugs. | Low | Weak |\n| Palliative radiotherapy maybe recommended for the management of painful bone metastases. | Moderate | Weak |\n| Appropriate nutritional intervention should be provided to all patients. | Moderate | Strong |\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\n## Contextualizing the Guidelines: Addressing Accessibility, Availability, and Cost Factors in India\n\nWhile we have outlined comprehensive guidelines for the management of HCC, it's crucial to consider the unique challenges of implementing these guidelines within the context of India. As a developing country with diverse economic and geographic conditions, India faces particular hurdles concerning the availability, accessibility, and cost of diagnostic tools and treatments for HCC. The reality is that many of the therapeutic modalities, while proven to be effective, are not accessible or affordable for a significant portion of the patient population. Moreover, advanced diagnostic tools may be out of reach for many healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, while these guidelines provide an ideal framework for managing HCC, they must be applied with consideration for these practical constraints.\n\nIt is essential that physicians adapt these guidelines to align with the resources at their disposal, without compromising on the quality of patient care. For instance, prioritizing treatments that offer the best balance of costeffectiveness and clinical benefit may be a necessary strategy. Furthermore, enhancing local capacities for HCC management, through measures such as improved training and infrastructure development, can help widen access to quality care.\n\nThese 2023 INASL guidelines for the management of intermediate and advanced HCC in India represent a significant advancement in enhancing patient care and establishing standardized practices nationwide. While our guidelines present the best practices for managing HCC, it is important to acknowledge that their implementation across India will need to navigate the challenges of clinical efficacy and practical feasibility. These guidelines should be seen as a flexible roadmap that can be adapted to individual patient circumstances and local resource availability.\n\nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | \u25a0 xxxx | Vol. xxx | No. xxx | xxxPlease cite this article as: Kumar et al., 2023 Update of Indian National Association for Study of the Liver Consensus on Management of Intermediate and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Puri..., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2023.08.005\n\n25\n\n\nFOLLOWING CONTEXT:\n\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n26    \u00a9 2023 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

They provide a comprehensive framework for diagnosis, staging, and treatment of HCC, striving to promote uniformity throughout the country. This is crucial in a diverse nation like India, where clinical practices may vary across regions. Standardizing approaches can help guarantee that all patients receive equitable care, irrespective of their geographical location.\n\nThese guidelines also serve as a foundation for future research on HCC in India. Although much of the current evidence is drawn from Western studies, these guidelines will be regularly updated and revised to incorporate new findings, especially those emerging from India. This iterative process ensures the ongoing relevance of the guidelines, enabling patients to benefit from the most up-to-date, evidence-based care available, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes and improving their quality of life.\n\n## CREDIT AUTHORSHIP CONTRIBUTION STATEMENT\n\nThe authors contributed to this manuscript as follows:\n\nSKA, AK, AD, SPS, PNR, KM: Conceptualization, Methodology.\n\nAK: Original draft preparation.\n\nSKA, SPS, MS: Supervision, Project administration.\n\nAD, PP: Funding acquisition.\n\nSKA, SPS, AD, KM, AS, AA, ACA, AB, ASS, BS, DD, DJ, DP, GS, JV, KK, MP, MKP, MW, MKS, MR, NK, PNR, PP, PB, PK, SRS, SSB, S, SBP, SG, SG, ST, VAS, YKC: Writing - Review & Editing.\n\nAll authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript.\n\nGiven his role as Associate Editor, Ashish Kumar was not involved in the peer review of this article and has no access to information regarding its peer review.
