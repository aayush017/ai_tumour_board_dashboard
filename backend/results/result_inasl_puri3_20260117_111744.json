  "consensus_plan": "**PRIMARY TREATMENT (per INASL for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven)):**\n\n**INASL GUIDELINE SUPPORT:**\n- **Hepatologist:** According to INASL guidelines, systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is recommended for patients with BCLC C stage HCC, particularly when performance status is driven by the tumor burden. This aligns with the patient's ECOG status of 1, which is likely due to the HCC rather than comorbidities, given the decompensated cirrhosis status (INASL SOURCE 1).\n- **Oncologist:** Reinforces the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line systemic therapy, provided there are no contraindications such as significant cardiovascular disorders (INASL SOURCE 3).\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThe patient is classified as BCLC C due to performance status driven by the tumor burden, as indicated by elevated AFP and the presence of a 4.2 cm lesion. Systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is appropriate given the absence of contraindications related to cardiovascular health. The patient's decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B) limits the feasibility of more invasive treatments like resection or locoregional therapies.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated, consider second-line systemic therapies as per INASL guidelines, such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib, depending on patient tolerance and specific contraindications.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular assessment to rule out contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to monitor treatment response and liver function.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular follow-up every 6-8 weeks to assess treatment response via imaging and AFP levels.\n- Monitor liver function tests and manage any complications of cirrhosis.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Development of significant cardiovascular symptoms or complications.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with agreement from the oncologist, based on INASL guidelines. No noted disagreements among specialists.\n\nThis consensus aligns with the INASL Puri 3 guidelines for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven), focusing on systemic therapy as the primary treatment approach. The decision is led by the hepatologist, considering the patient's specific clinical status and guideline recommendations.",

      "assessment": "**INASL GUIDELINE EVIDENCE:**\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 1]: \"Downstaging HCC before transplantation has demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in recurrence risk following transplantation... INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging is a viable option for patients within transplant criteria.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\nThe patient has a Child-Pugh score of B7 and a MELD score of 11, indicating moderate liver dysfunction. The portal hypertension risk is moderate, as suggested by the platelet count of 140.0K.\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 2], the patient is at BCLC stage C, which allows for locoregional therapies such as TACE, as well as systemic therapies. The INASL guidelines suggest that systemic therapy options include Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Tremelimumab-Durvalumab, and Durvalumab as first-line treatments [SOURCE 3].\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation, as they have a single lesion of 4.2 cm. According to INASL [SOURCE 1], patients within these criteria are eligible for transplantation, and downstaging is not required.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for the treatments discussed. However, the moderate risk of portal hypertension should be considered when evaluating the safety of invasive procedures.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\nPre-treatment interventions may include managing symptoms of decompensated cirrhosis, such as hyponatremia and thrombocytopenia, to optimize the patient's condition before initiating treatment.\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\nAs the LEAD decision maker, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven) would be to consider systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, given the patient's eligibility for transplantation and the potential for downstaging to improve outcomes. Locoregional therapy such as TACE could also be considered to manage the tumor burden while awaiting transplantation.\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the management of portal hypertension in the context of these treatments, nor does it provide specific guidance on the management of decompensated cirrhosis symptoms in this scenario. Further multidisciplinary discussion may be needed to tailor the treatment plan to the patient's specific needs.",
