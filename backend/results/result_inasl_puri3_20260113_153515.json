This aligns with the patient's elevated AFP and unilobar lesion, indicating significant tumor activity without vascular invasion or distant metastasis.\n- **Oncologist:** Reinforces the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line systemic therapy, with caution advised for patients with cardiovascular disorders, which are not present in this case.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThe patient is classified as BCLC C due to performance status driven by HCC, with a Child-Pugh score of B7 and MELD-Na of 16, indicating decompensated cirrhosis. The systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is appropriate given the tumor characteristics and the absence of contraindications such as significant cardiovascular issues. The treatment aims to manage the tumor burden and improve survival outcomes.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated due to unforeseen complications, alternative systemic therapies such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib may be considered, as per INASL guidelines.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular assessment to rule out any contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to monitor treatment response and liver function.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular follow-up every 6-8 weeks to assess treatment response via imaging and AFP levels.\n- Monitor liver function tests and manage any adverse effects promptly.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Development of cardiovascular symptoms or significant hypertension.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with unanimous agreement among specialists, based on INASL guidelines and patient-specific factors.\n\nThis consensus ensures that the treatment plan aligns with the INASL guidelines for BCLC C, focusing on systemic therapy as the primary approach, with careful monitoring and management of potential complications.",

      "assessment": "**INASL GUIDELINE EVIDENCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 1]: \"Downstaging HCC before transplantation has demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in recurrence risk following transplantation... INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered to potentially improve transplant eligibility and outcomes.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe patient has a Child-Pugh score of B7 and a MELD score of 11, indicating decompensated liver function. The portal hypertension risk is moderate, as indicated by thrombocytopenia (Plt 140.0K).\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 2], the INASL-BCLC staging system allows for locoregional therapies in stage C1, which may include TACE or TARE. Given the patient's decompensated liver status, systemic therapies may be considered, but careful assessment of liver function and potential contraindications is necessary.\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\n\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation (1 lesion, max 4.2 cm). According to INASL [SOURCE 1], patients within these criteria are eligible for transplantation, and downstaging therapies should be considered to optimize outcomes.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for this patient's treatment options. However, the moderate risk of portal hypertension should be considered when evaluating the safety and feasibility of invasive procedures.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\n\nPre-treatment interventions may include managing portal hypertension and optimizing liver function to improve the patient's candidacy for potential downstaging therapies or transplantation.\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\n\nAs the LEAD decision maker, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven) would be to consider locoregional therapies such as TACE or TARE to downstage the tumor, given the patient's eligibility for transplantation within the Milan and UCSF criteria. Systemic therapy options, such as Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, may also be considered, but careful monitoring of liver function and potential contraindications is essential.\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the specific impact of portal hypertension on treatment modalities in this context. Further multidisciplinary discussion may be needed to tailor the treatment plan to the patient's specific clinical scenario.",
