This aligns with the patient's ECOG status of 1 and elevated AFP indicating significant tumor burden. [INASL SOURCE 1]\n- **Oncologist:** Reinforces the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line systemic therapy, with caution advised for patients with cardiovascular disorders. [INASL SOURCE 3]\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThe patient is classified as BCLC C due to performance status driven by tumor burden, as indicated by elevated AFP levels. The INASL guidelines recommend systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab for such cases. The patient's liver function, while decompensated, is still within a range that allows for systemic therapy, and there are no contraindications related to cardiovascular conditions.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated due to cardiovascular issues or other factors, alternative systemic therapies such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib may be considered, as per INASL guidelines.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular assessment to rule out contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to monitor treatment response and potential side effects.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular follow-up every 6-8 weeks to assess treatment response via imaging and AFP levels.\n- Monitor for adverse effects related to systemic therapy, particularly hypertension and proteinuria.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Significant cardiovascular events or symptoms suggestive of Bevacizumab-related complications.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with agreement from the oncologist, based on INASL guidelines. No noted disagreements among specialists.\n\nThe primary treatment recommendation aligns with the BCLC C classification, focusing on systemic therapy as per INASL guidelines, with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab being the preferred first-line option. The decision is based on the patient's performance status and tumor characteristics, with careful consideration of potential contraindications.",

      "assessment": "**INASL GUIDELINE EVIDENCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 1]: \"Downstaging HCC before transplantation has demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in recurrence risk following transplantation... INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered to potentially improve transplant eligibility and outcomes.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe patient's liver function is assessed as Child-Pugh B7 and MELD 11, with a moderate risk of portal hypertension indicated by thrombocytopenia (Plt 140.0K). These scores reflect decompensated cirrhosis, which impacts treatment options and transplant eligibility.\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\n\nBased on the INASL guideline, the patient may tolerate locoregional therapies such as TACE, which is widely utilized for downstaging. Systemic therapies are also an option, with first-line treatments including Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Tremelimumab-Durvalumab, and Durvalumab [SOURCE 3]. However, the choice of systemic therapy should consider contraindications such as cardiovascular disorders or untreated high-risk esophageal varices.\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\n\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation (1 lesion, max 4.2 cm). According to INASL [SOURCE 1], patients within these criteria are eligible for transplantation, and downstaging therapies should be considered to optimize outcomes.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for the treatments discussed. However, the presence of moderate portal hypertension should be considered when evaluating the risk of bleeding and other complications associated with certain therapies.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\n\nPre-treatment interventions may include managing portal hypertension and optimizing liver function to improve the patient's overall condition before initiating downstaging or systemic therapies. The INASL guideline suggests that an aggressive approach to locoregional therapies combined with appropriate patient selection offers the most effective downstaging results [SOURCE 1].\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\n\nAs the LEAD decision maker, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven) would be to consider locoregional therapy such as TACE for downstaging, given the patient's eligibility for transplantation within the Milan and UCSF criteria. Concurrently, systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab could be considered, provided there are no contraindications related to cardiovascular health or esophageal varices [SOURCE 3].\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the management of portal hypertension in the context of specific treatments, nor does it provide detailed guidance on the extent or duration of AFP reduction required before considering liver transplantation. These areas may require further clinical judgment and multidisciplinary discussion.",
