This aligns with the patient's ECOG 1 status and elevated AFP indicating significant tumor burden. [INASL SOURCE 1]\n- **Oncologist:** Reinforces the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as first-line systemic therapy, with caution advised for patients with cardiovascular disorders. [INASL SOURCE 3]\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThe patient is classified as BCLC C due to performance status driven by HCC. The INASL guidelines recommend systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for this stage. The patient's liver function, while decompensated, is still within the range that may tolerate systemic therapy, and there is no evidence of cardiovascular contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated due to unforeseen cardiovascular issues, alternative systemic therapies such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib may be considered, as per INASL guidelines.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular assessment to rule out contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to monitor treatment response and liver function.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular follow-up every 4-6 weeks to assess treatment response via imaging and AFP levels.\n- Monitor liver function tests and manage any adverse effects promptly.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Development of cardiovascular symptoms that may contraindicate Bevacizumab.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with agreement from the oncologist, based on INASL guidelines. No noted disagreements among specialists.\n\nThe primary treatment recommendation aligns with the BCLC C classification, focusing on systemic therapy as per INASL guidelines. The decision is led by the hepatologist, ensuring adherence to the consensus process outlined in the INASL Puri 3 guidelines.",

      "assessment": "**INASL GUIDELINE EVIDENCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 1]: \"Downstaging HCC before transplantation has demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in recurrence risk following transplantation... INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered to potentially improve transplant eligibility and outcomes.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe patient's liver function is assessed as Child-Pugh B7 and MELD 11, with a moderate risk of portal hypertension indicated by thrombocytopenia (Plt 140.0K). These scores reflect decompensated cirrhosis, which impacts treatment options and transplant eligibility.\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\n\nBased on the INASL guideline, the patient may tolerate locoregional therapies such as TACE, which is widely utilized for downstaging. Systemic therapies are also an option, with first-line treatments including Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Tremelimumab-Durvalumab, and Durvalumab [SOURCE 3]. However, the patient's portal hypertension and liver function must be considered when selecting systemic therapies.\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\n\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation (1 lesion, max 4.2 cm). According to INASL [SOURCE 1], \"patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This suggests that the patient is currently eligible for transplant consideration without the need for downstaging.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for the treatments discussed. However, the presence of moderate portal hypertension should be considered when evaluating the risk of bleeding and other complications associated with certain therapies.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\n\nPre-treatment interventions may include managing portal hypertension and optimizing liver function to improve the patient's overall condition and treatment tolerance. The INASL guideline does not provide specific pre-treatment interventions for this scenario.\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\n\nAs the LEAD decision maker, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven) would be to consider systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, given the patient's eligibility for transplant and the potential for improved outcomes with this regimen [SOURCE 3]. Additionally, locoregional therapy such as TACE could be considered to manage the tumor burden and potentially improve transplant outcomes.\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the impact of portal hypertension on the choice of systemic therapy or the specific management of symptoms related to decompensated cirrhosis in this context. Further multidisciplinary discussion may be needed to tailor the treatment plan to the patient's specific clinical scenario.",
