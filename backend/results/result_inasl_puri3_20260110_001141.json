According to INASL guidelines, systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is recommended as the first-line treatment for patients with BCLC C, provided there are no contraindications such as significant cardiovascular disorders. [INASL SOURCE 1]\n- **Oncologist Assessment:** Supports the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line systemic therapy for BCLC C patients, emphasizing the need to avoid Bevacizumab in patients with cardiovascular issues. [INASL SOURCE 3]\n\n**RATIONALE:**\n- The patient\u2019s performance status (ECOG 1) and decompensated liver function (Child-Pugh B) align with BCLC C classification, necessitating systemic therapy. The INASL guidelines prioritize Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab for such cases, given the absence of contraindications related to cardiovascular health.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated due to cardiovascular concerns, alternative systemic therapies such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib may be considered, as per INASL guidelines.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation to rule out contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to establish a reference for treatment response.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular monitoring of liver function tests, AFP levels, and imaging every 8-12 weeks to assess treatment response and adjust therapy as needed.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Development of significant cardiovascular symptoms or complications.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with unanimous agreement among specialists, given the alignment with INASL guidelines and the absence of contraindications for the recommended systemic therapy.\n\nThis consensus ensures that the treatment plan is aligned with the INASL guidelines for BCLC C, focusing on systemic therapy as the primary approach due to the patient's performance status and liver function.",

INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered to potentially improve transplant eligibility and outcomes.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe patient has a Child-Pugh score of B7 and a MELD score of 11, indicating decompensated liver function. The portal hypertension risk is moderate, as suggested by the thrombocytopenia (Plt 140.0K).\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 3], first-line systemic therapies include Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Tremelimumab-Durvalumab, and Durvalumab. However, \"Avoid Bevacizumab in patients with cardiovascular disorders... and untreated high-risk esophageal varices.\" Given the patient's moderate portal hypertension, Bevacizumab may be contraindicated if high-risk varices are present.\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\n\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation (1 lesion, max 4.2 cm). According to INASL [SOURCE 1], \"patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" The patient is already within criteria, so downstaging is not necessary for eligibility.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\n\nINASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for systemic therapies, but it advises caution with Bevacizumab in the presence of untreated high-risk esophageal varices.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\n\nPre-treatment interventions may include managing portal hypertension and ensuring that any esophageal varices are treated to reduce bleeding risk, especially if considering therapies like Bevacizumab.\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\n\nGiven the patient's BCLC stage C and performance status, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 would be systemic therapy. Considering the potential contraindications with Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib or Sorafenib may be more suitable options. Additionally, locoregional therapies like TACE could be considered to manage the tumor burden and potentially improve liver function status.\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the management of portal hypertension in the context of systemic therapy selection, nor does it provide specific guidance on the management of hyponatremia in this setting. Further multidisciplinary discussion may be needed to tailor the treatment plan to the patient's specific clinical scenario.",
