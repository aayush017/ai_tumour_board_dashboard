According to INASL guidelines, systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is recommended as the first-line treatment for patients with BCLC C, provided there are no contraindications such as significant cardiovascular disorders. The patient's ECOG status of 1 and absence of major cardiovascular issues support this choice. [INASL SOURCE 1]\n- **Oncologist Assessment:** Reinforces the use of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab as the first-line systemic therapy for BCLC C, with caution advised for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. [INASL SOURCE 3]\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThe decision to proceed with systemic therapy using Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is driven by the patient's BCLC C classification, which is performance status-driven. The patient's ECOG status of 1 and the absence of significant cardiovascular contraindications align with INASL guidelines for systemic therapy. The presence of decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B) limits the feasibility of locoregional therapies and surgical options, making systemic therapy the most appropriate choice.\n\n**ALTERNATIVES (if primary contraindicated per INASL):**\n- If Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is contraindicated due to unforeseen cardiovascular issues, alternative systemic therapies such as Sorafenib or Lenvatinib may be considered, as per INASL guidelines for BCLC C patients.\n\n**PREREQUISITES:**\n- Comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation to rule out contraindications for Bevacizumab.\n- Baseline imaging and laboratory tests to establish a reference for monitoring treatment response.\n\n**MONITORING (per INASL):**\n- Regular follow-up every 6-8 weeks to assess treatment response and manage potential side effects.\n- Monitoring of liver function tests, AFP levels, and imaging studies to evaluate tumor response and progression.\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Worsening liver function or signs of acute decompensation.\n- Development of significant cardiovascular symptoms or complications.\n\n**CONSENSUS STATUS:**\n- Hepatologist-led decision with unanimous agreement among specialists, based on INASL guidelines and patient-specific factors.\n\nThis consensus ensures that the primary treatment aligns with the BCLC C classification and INASL guidelines, focusing on systemic therapy as the most suitable option for this patient.",

INASL recommends that patients who exceed the UCSF criteria but have good liver function, no vascular invasion, and no distant spread may be considered for transplantation if defined morphological and biological endpoints of successful downstaging are achieved.\" This indicates that downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered to potentially improve transplant eligibility and outcomes.\n\n**LIVER FUNCTION ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe patient has a Child-Pugh score of B7 and a MELD score of 11, indicating decompensated liver function. The portal hypertension risk is moderate, as suggested by the thrombocytopenia (Plt 140.0K).\n\n**TREATMENT TOLERANCE:**\n\nAccording to INASL [SOURCE 2], the INASL-BCLC staging system allows for locoregional therapies in stage C1, which may include TACE or TARE. Given the patient's liver function and portal hypertension, systemic therapies may also be considered, as outlined in [SOURCE 3]: \"First-line systemic therapies include Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Tremelimumab-Durvalumab, and Durvalumab.\"\n\n**TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY:**\n\nThe patient is within the Milan and UCSF criteria for liver transplantation (1 lesion, max 4.2 cm). According to INASL [SOURCE 1], patients within these criteria are eligible for transplantation, and downstaging therapies should be considered to optimize outcomes.\n\n**PORTAL HYPERTENSION CONTRAINDICATIONS:**\n\nINASL guideline does not explicitly address specific contraindications related to portal hypertension for the treatments mentioned. However, the moderate risk of portal hypertension should be considered when evaluating the safety and feasibility of locoregional therapies.\n\n**OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:**\n\nPre-treatment interventions may include downstaging therapies such as TACE or TARE to improve transplant eligibility and outcomes, as recommended by INASL [SOURCE 1].\n\n**LEAD HEPATOLOGIST RECOMMENDATION (per INASL):**\n\nAs the LEAD decision maker, the primary first-line treatment approach per INASL Puri 3 for BCLC C (Performance Status Driven) would be to consider systemic therapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, given the patient's eligibility and the absence of contraindications for Bevacizumab. Additionally, locoregional therapies such as TACE or TARE should be considered for downstaging purposes to optimize transplant eligibility.\n\n**CONFIDENCE NOTE:**\n\nThe INASL guideline does not explicitly address the specific impact of portal hypertension on the choice of locoregional therapies. Further multidisciplinary discussion may be needed to tailor the treatment plan to the patient's specific clinical scenario.",
